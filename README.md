# DEEL FRONTEND TEST

This project was initiated with Create React App, Typescript support.

# About App

This is an autocomplete component built with React and Typescript. The casestudy is a list of fruits available in a product collection. The input autofocuses on default to see collections and users can click on see all collections to see all fruits and their description.\

When users enters their search query, it filters fruits based on availability and highlight the words that matches. Users can select a fruit it becomes highlighted as selected fruit. In real life production scenario, selected fruits can lead to the product description page or selected for checkout.


## Available Scripts and RUN Description

After unzipping the file, run `yarn install` to add node_modules and other default dependencies (no external dependencies).

After installation,\
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
